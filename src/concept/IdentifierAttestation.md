# Identifier Attestation #

Identifier Attestation is a technology that bridges web2 and web3 in the area of token ownership. It enables the use of traditional web identifiers, such as email addresses or social media handles, to claim ownership of blockchain tokens. This approach aims to lower the barriers to entry for blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, making them more accessible to a wider audience.

In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, ownership of assets is typically tied to a cryptographic key pair. This system, while secure, can be daunting for newcomers, as it requires a level of technical understanding and careful key management. Identifier Attestation simplifies this process by allowing users to claim ownership of tokens using identifiers they are already familiar with.

The process of Identifier Attestation involves two main steps: attestation and token issuance. In the attestation step, a trusted entity verifies the user's ownership of a web2 identifier. Once the user has verified their ownership, the attestor signs a message confirming this fact. This signed message, known as an attestation, can then be used to prove the user's ownership of the identifier on the blockchain.

In the token issuance step, the user can use the attestation to claim ownership of blockchain tokens. This is done by creating a commitment, a kind of cryptographic promise, to the identifier. This commitment can then be used to issue tokens to the user, without the need for a crypto wallet or private key.

Identifier Attestation can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as token airdrops, access control, and voting systems. By allowing users to interact with blockchain systems using familiar identifiers, Identifier Attestation can help to lower the barriers to entry and drive wider adoption of blockchain technologies.

The inner work of identifier attestation involves the use of [zero-knowledge commitment from the identifier](../research/IdentifierAttestation.md).
