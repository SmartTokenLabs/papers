# The Stunted Development of Web 2.0 and the 'Limit of 3' Problem

<p id="sentence1">The current web thrives on integration, yet its growth has been hindered by the lack of secure, privacy-preserving, and decentralised mechanisms to facilitate such integration.</p>

<p id="sentence2">After decades into the Web 2.0 era, the majority of websites still depend on three primary types of integrations: login, social media posting, and checkout, typically facilitated by Google ID, Twitter, and Apple Pay, respectively. Despite integrations being the bedrock of the web's functionality, websites are generally unable to incorporate more than these three. This phenomenon, known as the 'Limit of 3' problem, signifies the typical maximum number of integrations a website can have.</p>

<p id="sentence3">To envision the potential of the next-generation web, consider an airplane ticket. Currently, this ticket, as a token, only holds value within its issuing platform, such as an airline or online travel agent. But imagine if this ticket could be integrated across various systems. It could update your travel status on social media, guide you to your gate via Google Maps, or automatically communicate flight changes to your hotel or car booking systems. These straightforward use-cases have been long overdue, yet remain unimplemented due to the siloed nature of the web, with centralized points offering only piecemeal solutions.</p>

<p id="sentence4">The Smart Layer is designed to transcend this 'Limit of 3' problem, fostering a new level of integration and paving the way for the next-generation web, where smart tokens serve as both the integration points and the foundational building blocks.</p>
