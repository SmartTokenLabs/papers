# Why do we need Smart Layer?

The next generation of web has limitless integrations. Smart Layer is a key component - the integration bus of the next web.

## Web 2.0 excels in integration, yet its growth is constrained

The digital landscape is becoming increasingly complex with a web of integrations that are permission-based, costly, and privacy-invading. Traditional integrations, such as social logins or payment systems, are largely controlled by a few major internet giants, creating a monopolistic and potentially exploitative system. Moreover, these integrations are often siloed, failing to recognize and transfer user data such as reputation or credentials across platforms, which severely restricts the scope and potential of the internet. Even more, the current infrastructure struggles to accommodate the volume and diversity of interactions required for a fully integrated web. This is evident in the evolving context of AI, which is expected to act as a user agent but lacks the necessary framework to securely and efficiently interact with a multitude of web services.

**Pre-blockchain centralised solutions fall short**: Traditional integration methods, even two decades post-Web 2.0, can manage only basic functionalities - login, social networking, and checkout - without getting overly complex or invasive.

**Blockchain is an essential part of the solution**, but itself fall short thanks to its structure. With rule-based smart contracts at the core, it is ill-suited for service networks, compromising both performance and privacy.

## Smart Layer: The Integration Bus of the Next Web

The escalating complexity of digital systems calls for an integration layer that simplifies and scales integration tasks. This layer should be decentralized to prevent tech giants from hindering the evolution of the next-generation web. The Smart Layer, designed as a service network using public blockchains for decentralization and rule enforcement, is our solution for the next web.

The Smart Layer leverages blockchain technology to offer a layer of integration that enables trustless token logic, facilitating a tokenized web with unlimited integration potential. It acts as an interface that allows token code to be executed within digital environments, managing the accounting, issuance, revocation, or expiration of tokens. This ensures privacy and security while paving the way for limitless integration.

With the rapid digitalization of our world and the growing importance of AI, a seamless, secure, and user-friendly web experience is more vital than ever. The Smart Layer addresses this need by offering an integrated, tokenized web where users have more control over their data and AI can function more efficiently. It allows for limitless potential for new API calls as more people define new tokens and find new uses for them, while preserving privacy by ensuring that most user data does not need to be recorded on the blockchain.

In conclusion, the Smart Layer is essential for a more dynamic, integrated, and user-empowered internet. It stands as a deployable service container that uses TokenScript to allow tokens to provide new APIs without service network redeployment, designed for high traffic, and employs encryption and secure computation for privacy.
