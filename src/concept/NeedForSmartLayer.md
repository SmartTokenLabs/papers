# Need for Smart Layer

With the rapid digitalization of our world and the growing importance of AI, the need for a seamless, secure, and user-friendly web experience is more vital than ever. The Smart Layer facilitates this by offering an integrated, tokenized web where users have more control over their data and AI can function more efficiently. It allows for limitless potential for new API calls as more people define new tokens and find new uses for them. Also, it ensures that most user data does not need to be recorded on the blockchain, preserving privacy. Hence, the Smart Layer is essential for a more dynamic, integrated, and user-empowered internet.
