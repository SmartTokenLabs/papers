# Tokenisation

Tokenisation transforms goods, services, and digital rights into programmable tokens, enabling seamless integration, frictionless market, and user empowerment across digital environments.

Tokenisation, as facilitated by TokenScript and enhanced by the Smart Layer, is a transformative process that enables a frictionless market and seamless web integration. It achieves this by converting goods, services, and digital rights into programmable and composable components. These components derive their authenticity from the blockchain and interact with integrated business processes through programmable interfaces.

Let's consider a more integrated example: a concert ticket. When a concert ticket is tokenised, it's not just a pass to a music event. It becomes a [Smart Token](SmartToken.md) that carries a wealth of information and potential interactions. For instance, it could contain data about the holder's seat, the event's date and time, and the venue's location. It could also include special privileges like backstage access or merchandise discounts.

But the real power of tokenisation comes from integration. This tokenised ticket could be linked to the holder's social media account, allowing them to share their attendance with friends. It could be integrated with mapping services, providing direct navigation to the venue. If the concert is postponed or cancelled, the token could automatically trigger refunds to the holders. It could even be traded or sold in a secondary market, all while maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the original ticket.

In essence, the [benefit of tokenisation](TokenizationBenefits.md) lies in its ability to create smart tokens that can act as integration points, streamlining and facilitating interactions between systems. It's about transforming the functionalities of websites and digital rights of users into programmable components that can interact with various systems, creating a more dynamic, integrated, and user-empowered internet.
