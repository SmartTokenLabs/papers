# Role of Smart Layer in Future Internet

The Smart Layer plays a crucial role in the future of the internet. It acts as a bridge between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 environments, executing token code and managing tokens with agility and efficiency. It affords high traffic loads, ensures privacy, and provides real-time APIs to accommodate the ever-evolving landscape of tokens and their applications. Most importantly, the Smart Layer becomes the connective tissue between AI and the web, fostering a more dynamic, secure, and less centralized method for AI to access and interact with the web. In a future where everything is tokenized, the Smart Layer is the enabler of an integrated, user-empowered internet.
