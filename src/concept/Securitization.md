# Securitisation

Securitisation is a financial process that involves transforming non-liquid assets into securities that can be traded. This concept is a cornerstone of modern finance and plays a crucial role in liquidity management and risk diversification.

However, securitisation does not depend on [tokenisation](Tokenization.md). It's a process that was invented before the advent of computers and does not require the use of smart tokens. [Smart tokens](SmartToken.md), on the other hand, are programmable tokens that represent both a tradable asset and the user's right to integrate with various web systems, enabling next-generation web use-cases.

In contrast, securitisation does not have web use-cases and is primarily used for liquidity management and risk diversification. For instance, shared ownership of a car through securitisation does not enable you to drive that car or enjoy services related to that car such as finding the nearest rentable car that is tokenised.

Tokenisation, on the other hand, is used to convert goods, services, and digital rights into smart tokens that can be used to enable a wide range of use-cases, such as renting your smart car by doing a transaction on a rental website, which are not possible through securitisation.
