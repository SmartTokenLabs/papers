# Reduce counter-party risk

Smart use of Cheque protocol can improve security through minimising counter-party risk and attack surface.

For example, an exchange can get an order from a user to sell their cryptocurrency at certain price. Later when the order can be filled, the exchange can counter-sign the order and execute it. This can happen even when the user is offline.

Therefore the user does not need to deposite their cryptocurrency into the exchange's account prior to the trade, minimising counter party risk. The exchange account will be holding cryptocurrency only for a short time, minimising attack surface.
