# The Car Ownership Token: A Case Study in Smart Token Integration

The fusion of frictionless markets through asset tokenization and web integration via smart tokens as integration points can be exemplified through the concept of a car token. This is merely one instance among a plethora of potential applications, extending to realms such as real estate markets, business-to-business transactions, and resource transfers, essentially any transaction involving digital goods or a digital representation of a physical good.

The car token serves as a practical illustration to comprehend these concepts. A car, in this context, is a tokenized asset that can be purchased, sold, transferred, auctioned, collaborated upon, and insured, all facilitated by the blockchain. 

Simultaneously, a car possesses utility. A car's ownership token can transform a blockchain wallet into a car key, with additional functionalities such as visually representing the car's current location. Authorizing someone to access your car or renting it out for profit could be seamlessly executed by signing blockchain transactions or attestations, eliminating the need to physically exchange car keys.

In both scenarios, the token embodies the delivery aspect: they *are* the product. These tokens can interact with non-token forms of payment, but tokenizing the payments would render the entire process more streamlined.

The following image of a car token symbolizes the ultimate stage of tokenization.

At first glance, it appears to be a convenient portal to manage everything about the car, including market functions and utility. However, this is not feasible with the traditional web model. In the web 2.0 model, you are constrained to manage each element individually:

* Registering the car involves a separate process that requires creating an account with the Road and Maritime Services and manually proving ownership without the aid of cryptography. 
* When you want to insure the car, you have to create another account and manually provide proof of its registration to that new service. 
* Similarly, if you want to make the car available for sharing economy through Uber or hour-based car rental, the task of proving and settling payments and insurance cost adds friction to the market.

The intended portal does not enable these functions by itself but merely serves as a gateway to merge a lot of different accounts as we know it from the current web. It's just another temporary solution, which conceals

paper trail processes from the user, without addressing the underlying issue.

Now, let's envision this in the context of the next-generation web where such elements can be tokenized, step by step: 

__Purchasing and Registration__: The Vendor (in this case, Holden) provides an ownership token to the new owner, which can be used to operate the car. The token, transferred to the owner at the time of purchase, is subsequently used to acquire the registration token. An inbuilt IoT device allows the car to be operated with proof of ownership via a token.

__Insurance__: The owner, desiring to purchase insurance, only needs to provide the proof of ownership and registration token to meet the requirements with the insurance company. The insurance company's standards are automatically met by matching the tokens to their requirements. Once validated, the insurance company can send the owner an insurance token in exchange for payment. The insurance token carries its own functions and services.

Smart tokens bridge the gap between different providers and services, which used to be built by accounts, trust, and paperwork.

__Uber__: If the owner wishes to become an Uber driver, she can easily prove her vehicle's eligibility by providing proof of ownership, insurance, and registration with her tokens. Uber then automatically provides her with an Uber token which, depending on the owner's need, can be used to start as an Uber driver or allow a third-party driver to do so. None of these processes require manual verification or account creation.

Smart tokens enable a more flexible, even programmable, use of ownership rights and their interaction, as centralized, account-based services can provide.

__Self-Uber__: Taking this even further, the owner can bypass Uber altogether and rent her car directly to strangers. To ensure her car isn't mishandled by some random stranger, she can restrict her renters to those who have an attestation-based token issued by the 'better drivers bureau'. The renter proves they have this token, pays a sum to the owner, and is atomically issued with a temporary token that allows them to unlock and use the car for a certain period. This is done without the creation of an account or the need to submit tons of documents to be validated manually by the owner.

__Selling__: If the owner wishes to sell the car, she only has to list it on any website with a price. The ownership token and payment can be swapped atomically (ensuring neither the buyer nor seller is cheated), and the new owner can drive away with the car without even meeting the original owner face-to-face. The new buyer knows in advance whether the car has been registered and is legally owned by merely validating the original owner's ownership token in their wallet. The original owner's token is invalidated once the swap occurs, and she can no longer operate the car. It is also possible to automatically void the insurance policy once the exchange has occurred and provide the original owner with a rebate for premature cancellation.

This chapter serves to present the vision. Smart tokens enable the entire ownership and utility processes around car trading and sharing to happen automatically, fraud-proof, and atomic. This eliminates a lot of friction and allows much more flexibility to individualize the economic transactions.

We will have the opportunity to inspect the technical aspect of this well-integrated, well-tokenized car token in later chapters again.
