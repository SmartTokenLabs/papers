# Case Study 1

Integration Point: Map app
Use Case: The Map app switches to the airport internal view and highlight the path to board the plane, changing gate if needed.

In this scenario, no data is shared between parties in a centralized mechanism where all data is collected together; instead, integrations happen on the fly. Integrations are created, used, and discarded as use-cases arise and end. Similarly, in the visa application case, the visa application website is not permanently connected to the airlines - the airlines merely provided proof of the userâ€™s ticket and any updates needed through the smart layer. The user consented so by the act of using its airline ticket, and no further booking or movement of the user is ever sent to the visa application after the use-case ended. Such is the ephemeral token-based integration using Smart Layer. [Page 7]
