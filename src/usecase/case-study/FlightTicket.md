## Case Study: Airplane Ticket Integration

Airplane ticket is a good example to illustrate the potential of Smart Layer's integration capabilities. Traditionally, such integration is impractical because it often requires connections to airline websites or an airline aggregator, which either increased the attack surface (consider banking app), or invaded the user privacy as the airline needs to provide user data to websites such as YouTube. But with a token approach and Smart Layer, the user holds a token that represents their flight ticket and uses it to join the computation matrix provided by Smart Layer nodes.

- **Integration Point**: Visa Application System
  - **Use Case**: The flight ticket token can be used to submit a visa-on-arrival application, reducing paperwork and streamlining the process.

- **Integration Point**: Social Media Platforms
  - **Use Case**: Friends and family can be automatically updated of the user's arrival time, enhancing social connection.

- **Integration Point**: Car Booking Services
  - **Use Case**: The user can access car booking services directly through their flight ticket token, improving travel convenience.

- **Integration Point**: Hotel Reservation Systems
  - **Use Case**: If the flight is delayed, the user's hotel reservation can be automatically adjusted, providing peace of mind and flexibility.

- **Integration Point**: Banking Apps
  - **Use Case**: The banking app recognizes the user's travel plan based on the flight ticket token, providing relevant services such as currency conversion options and security adjustments.

- **Integration Point**: Music/Video Streaming Services
  - **Use Case**: Spotify and YouTube can adjust their content offerings based on the user's travel status and destination, enhancing the user experience.

- **Integration Point**: Map app
  - **Use Case**: The Map app switches to the airport internal view and highlight the path to board the plane, changing gate if needed.

In this scenario, no data is shared between parties in a centralised mechanism where all data is collected together; instead, integrations happen on the fly. Integrations are created, used, and discarded as use-cases arise and end.

Similarly, in the visa application case, the visa application website is not permanently connected to the airlines - the airlines merely provided proof of the user's ticket and any updates needed through the smart layer. The user consented so by the act of using its airline ticket, and no further booking or movement of the user is ever sent to the visa application after the use-case ended. Such is the ephemeral token-based integration using Smart Layer.
