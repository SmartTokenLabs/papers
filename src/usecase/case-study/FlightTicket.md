# Case Study: Flight Ticket Integration

Flight tickets serve as an excellent example to demonstrate the potential of Smart Layer's integration capabilities. Traditional integration methods often necessitated connections to airline websites or an airline aggregator. Such connections either expanded the attack surface (especially in banking apps) or compromised user privacy, as airlines had to share user data with platforms like YouTube. However, with the token approach facilitated by Smart Layer, users possess a token symbolizing their flight ticket, enabling them to participate in the computation matrix offered by Smart Layer nodes.

## Integration Points and Use Cases:

- **Integration Point**: Visa Application System
  - **Use Case**: The flight ticket token streamlines visa-on-arrival applications by minimizing paperwork.

- **Integration Point**: Social Media Platforms
  - **Use Case**: Automatic updates about a user's arrival time can be sent to friends and family, fostering social connections.

- **Integration Point**: Car Booking Services
  - **Use Case**: Users can seamlessly access car booking services via their flight ticket token, enhancing travel convenience.

- **Integration Point**: Hotel Reservation Systems
  - **Use Case**: In case of flight delays, hotel reservations are auto-adjusted, ensuring peace of mind and flexibility.

- **Integration Point**: Banking Apps
  - **Use Case**: Banking apps can tailor services like currency conversion and security adjustments based on the flight ticket token.

- **Integration Point**: Music/Video Streaming Services
  - **Use Case**: Platforms like Spotify and YouTube can modify content based on the user's travel status and destination, enriching the user experience.

- **Integration Point**: Map App
  - **Use Case**: The app transitions to an internal airport view, highlighting the path to the boarding gate and suggesting gate changes if necessary.

## Benefits of Flight Ticket Integration:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users benefit from streamlined processes and personalized services across various platforms.
2. **Data Privacy**: Token-based integration ensures user data remains private, with no centralized data collection.
3. **Flexibility**: Ephemeral integrations can be created and discarded as needed, offering dynamic solutions for varying use cases.
4. **Reduced Attack Surface**: By eliminating the need for direct connections to airline websites, the risk of potential cyberattacks is minimized.

## Considerations:

1. **User Consent**: It's crucial to ensure users are aware of and consent to the integrations, especially regarding data sharing.
2. **Integration Complexity**: While Smart Layer simplifies integration, understanding and implementing token-based interactions might require a learning curve for some organizations.
3. **Data Accuracy**: The accuracy of data, especially in real-time scenarios like flight delays, is essential to ensure seamless user experiences.

In the given visa application scenario, the visa application platform isn't perpetually linked to airlines. Instead, airlines provide the necessary proof of the user's ticket and any required updates via Smart Layer. The user's consent is implicit in their use of the flight ticket, and no subsequent booking or movement data is shared with the visa application once the use case concludes. This ephemeral, token-based integration epitomizes the capabilities of Smart Layer.

Note that a guide (in draft stage) for developers on the internal work of activating such a token is in the [air.cab guide](../guide/air.cab.md).
