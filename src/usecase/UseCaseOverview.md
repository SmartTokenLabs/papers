# Use Case Overview

The Smart Layer network is designed to facilitate a wide range of use cases through its token-incentivised distributed network of service nodes. Two such use cases are the Smart Car Token and the Smart Health Token.

## Smart Car Token

The Smart Car Token is a digital token issued by smart car companies. This token can be used to access and control various features of a smart car, such as unlocking the car, starting the engine, or adjusting the car's settings. 

For example, a user might use a Smart Car Token to unlock their car using their smartphone. The request would be sent to a service node, which would validate the token and execute the unlock operation. The operation would then be recorded as a commitment by an anchoring node, providing a traceable record of the operation.

The Smart Car Token could also be used for more complex operations, such as scheduling a car service or updating the car's software. These operations would be defined in the token's smart contract and executed by the service nodes.

## Smart Health Token

The Smart Health Token is a digital token used to access and manage health-related data and services. This could include accessing medical records, scheduling appointments, or managing prescriptions.

For example, a user might use a Smart Health Token to access their medical records. The request would be sent to a service node, which would validate the token and retrieve the requested records. The operation would then be recorded as a commitment by an anchoring node, providing a traceable record of the operation.

The Smart Health Token could also be used to manage prescriptions. A user could use the token to request a prescription refill, which would be processed by a service node and recorded by an anchoring node.

In both of these use cases, the Smart Layer network provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for managing and executing token operations. The network's service nodes handle the processing and execution of operations, while the anchoring nodes provide a traceable record of operations, ensuring transparency and accountability.
