The Smart Layer presents a groundbreaking approach to address these issues. By leveraging blockchain technology, it offers a layer of integration that enables trustless token logic, facilitating a tokenized web with unlimited integration potential. The Smart Layer acts as an interface that permits token code to be executed within the digital environments, managing the accounting, issuance, revocation, or expiration of tokens. This means that the Smart Layer not only paves the way for limitless integration but also ensures privacy and security. [Page 10]

Users could then review this plan, evaluate the prices and actions, and approve the action plan, thereby permitting the use of their private keys. [Page 4]
