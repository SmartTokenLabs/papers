# Smart Layer: A Decentralized Integration Protocol for the Next-Generation Web

1st Septempber, 2023

## Abstract

In the evolving landscape of the decentralized web, the need for a robust integration layer that bridges the gap between siloëd services and tokenized assets has become paramount. Smart Layer emerges as a decentralized network designed to facilitate the next generation of web use-cases, addressing the inherent limitations of the current web. This whitepaper delves into the architecture, design, and potential of Smart Layer and its token, aiming to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with the web.

## Introduction

The evolution of the web has been marked by periods of rapid innovation, leading to an era of unprecedented connectivity and information exchange. Observations of tech giants like Google have underscored the potential benefits of integrated services. However, despite these advancements, the broader web landscape has remained fragmented. Centralized entities have emerged as dominant forces, creating isolated ecosystems that limit true integration. While blockchain technology introduced a new paradigm with its emphasis on decentralization and trustless transactions, its primary focus has been on asset tokenization.

In this context, Smart Layer emerges—a decentralized protocol that aspires to redefine the web's architecture. Envisioned as an integration bus, Smart Layer facilitates seamless interactions between diverse services, akin to how websites today leverage platforms like Google for a myriad of functionalities. Beyond acting as a mere bridge, Smart Layer introduces the concept of Smart Tokens. These are tokenized digital rights and products/services that can be seamlessly integrated across various web use-cases, transcending the limitations of centralized systems and leveraging the strengths of blockchain. This protocol is designed to function as a distributed network, serving as the backbone for the next generation of the web.

## Problem Statement

The modern web, for all its advancements, grapples with a fundamental challenge: the 'Limit of 3' problem. Despite the web's inherent nature of integration, most websites today are confined to three primary types of integrations: login, social media posting, and checkout. This limitation stems from a combination of privacy concerns, integration costs, and the absence of a secure, privacy-preserving mechanism to facilitate expansive integration.

Moreover, the web's siloëd nature has led to fragmented user experiences. Consider the example of an airplane ticket. In the current web paradigm, this ticket, while representing a token of value within its issuing platform, remains isolated. The potential for this ticket to integrate with other systems – updating travel statuses on social media, guiding users via mapping services, or communicating flight changes to hotel booking systems – remains largely untapped. Such straightforward integrations, though long overdue, are hindered by the web's compartmentalized structure, where centralized entities offer piecemeal solutions. 

This state of affairs underscores the need for a paradigm shift, a move towards a more dynamic and interconnected web ecosystem. The following sections will delve into how Smart Layer addresses these challenges, laying the foundation for the next-generation web.
