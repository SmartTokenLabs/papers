    <title>Token Negotiation</title>
    <shortdesc>Token Negotiation is how a website discovers tokens it can use</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Token Negotiation is the process by which Tokens and Websites negotiate to find the
            match.</p>
        <p>For example, a travel booking website like booking.com might negotiate for the following
            tokens:</p>
        <ul id="ul_yqp_k5t_pmb">
            <li>Travel agent's status token which allows special travel-agent booking.</li>
            <li>Any airfare token which included free overnight stay for certain hotels.</li>
            <li>Priority Guest Rewards tokens, which might allows free upgrades for certain
                hotels.</li>
            <li>Any Payment Token that can be used to pay for the booking (e.g. American Express
                Explorer Credit).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The website booking.com find and allow the users to use such tokens through
            TokenNegitation.</p>
      <p>TokenScript provides the following negotiation methods:<ol id="ol_egq_bvt_pmb">
                <li>Attribute based negotiation, which requires the negotiable attributes to be
                    declared in TokenScripts.</li>
                <li>Attestation based negotiation, by which a website provides an attestation signed
                    by a token issuer's trust key, showing that the token is intended to be usable
                    on that website;</li>
                <li>Expectation based negotiation, by which a token declare being able to do certain
                    things (e.g. let the website receives up to 1ETH in payment).</li>
            </ol></p><p>More on this later. Token Negotiation is a work in progress.</p>
