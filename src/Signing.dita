    <title>Signing a TokenScript</title>
    <shortdesc>TokenScript files are signed by the token issuer or a trusted third party, so that a
        wallet can verify the TokenScript. Learn about the underlying trust models and how to sign
        your TokenScript.</shortdesc>

        <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-1d4e618f-7fff-5cbf-a973-b4ead0df755d">The TokenScript
            files can be signed by two keys:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>Reputation Key</dt>
                    <dd>This key goes together with a certificate that associates the signer with a
                        website or a real world organisation.</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
			<dt><xref href="TokenScript-SigningKey.dita"/></dt>
                    <dd>This key associates the signer with the smart contract to which transactions
                        are sent, showing that the smart contract team trusts the TokenScript's
                        signer (which could be the same people).</dd>
                </dlentry>
            </dl></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Reputation key let's user accept the TokenScript based on the reputation of the
            website or organisation. You need to have a X.509 certificate for a website that you own
            or, if budget allows, a <xref
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate" format="html"
                scope="external">EV certificate</xref>.</p>
        <p>[Editor's note: unify the terminology here. Authenticity or Reputation.]</p>
        <p dir="ltr">There are two ways to establish trust into the signer: <i>Providing
                Authenticity</i> and <i>Express of Trust</i>. Both should be available in the
            future, but currently only Express of Trust is.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Express of Trust requires to sign the files with a key assosiated with
            TokenScript. This can be done by the Token issuer himself with a key associated with the
            smart contract which created the token. </p>
        <p dir="ltr">But it can also be done by another party, which gained trust from the token
            issuer. This can be done by a transaction to the public key of the TokenScript author or
            by a modification of the token smart contract to return the TokenScript author’s key.
            Another method to gain trust is by having established a trustworthy reputation. When a
            user uses a TokenScript, his wallet displays the domain name or organisation name of the
            certificate. It's up to the user if he trusts the TokenScript.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">It is important to be able to delegate the trust from the token issuer to other
            parties. For example, someone created a dollar token, but doesn’t want to create all the
            TokenScrips necessary. So another party can write them to cover all kinds of smart
            contracts. It would even be possible for the authors of smart contracts to write
            TokenScripts coverings their contract on behalf of token issuers.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Proof of Authenticity can be used in the future. In this model, a smart
            contract returns the signing key needed for TokenScript. </p>
        <p dir="ltr">Any data reference - icons, images and language packs - used by the TokenScript
            must be referred to in the &lt;SignedInfo> section of the XML signature using the
            &lt;Reference> element. If they don’t, they will not be available for the user agent.
            Each reference is downloaded and its digest verified as part of the TokenScript
            signature verification process. If any of the references fails to download or the digest
            doesn't match, the entire XML signature is considered invalid.</p>
        <p><b>How to sign a TokenScript</b></p>
        <p>Signature in TokenScript is a standard XML signature.</p>
        <p>For the Reputation key, any signature algorithms supported by XML is accepted, including
            ECDSA.</p>
