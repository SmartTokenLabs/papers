# Author's Note: Tokens and Tokenisation in Focus

The blockchain speculation frenzy of 2017 - 2018 shone a glaring spotlight on crypto tokens. Amidst the tumult of buying and selling, we seemed to lose sight of the fact that these crypto technologies were intended for practical use by its founding designers, much like forgetting that houses, amidst a housing bubble, are fundamentally places to live, not just speculative assets.

Blockchain, at its core, serves as a trusted third party. However, to fully appreciate its role, we must delve deeper into its relevance to the global economy and the next-generation web. As technical experts who have dedicated years to researching and experimenting with its applications across financial institutions and startups, we've discerned that blockchain, in its capacity as a trusted third party, fulfills two primary functions:

1. It facilitates a frictionless market.
2. It integrates the web.

These functions are enabled by tokens, which serve as the fundamental building blocks of the blockchain ecosystem. But, as we've come to realize, these tokens can be more than just passive carriers of value. They can serve as trust anchors, providing a reliable basis for trust and facilitating seamless integration with various web applications. We term the technique of harnessing this potential as "Tokenisation".

Tokenised rights, when traded on the market and integrated across systems, foster a seamless market and enable boundless integration. Now, imagine if these tokens were not just passive carriers of value, but could actively interact with their environment, make decisions, and adapt to changing circumstances. This is the concept of Smart Tokens, a new layer of sophistication added to the basic token model.

While previous efforts in this field have largely concentrated on enhancing technical aspects such as transaction throughput, our project shifts the focus to tokenisation and the potential of Smart Tokens, which operate in the functional dimension. We introduce a standardisation effort known as TokenScript, which complements the blockchain technical stack and provides utility for the economy and the next-generation web.

The work on TokenScript is ongoing at tokenscript.org and we are looking to standardise it through a standardisation organisation. We invite you to follow our progress closely and join us on this enlightening journey!
