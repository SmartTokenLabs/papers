# What can be tokenised?

Could we tokenise a house, enabling its automation systems to recognise friends and guests by connecting to social networks, or allowing the owner to apply for insurance, buy services, and more?

Could we tokenise electricity, allowing power users to benefit from finer scheduling of the use of resources, and households to benefit from collecting surplus sun energy?

Could we tokenise AirBNB bookings, so that hosts can purchase a guaranteed cash flow from the market, while speculators profit from predicting the travel needs?

Could we tokenise books, creating a new paradigm where authors could issue tokens representing ownership or access rights to their works, enabling them to directly monetise their intellectual property and readers to trade or sell their purchased books in a secondary market?

Could we create an insurance token that depends on cryptographic proofs, so that the insurer can remove the costs incurred by fraudulent documents from the pricing? Could we go even further, so a car insurance token connects the car's operating system and allow the insurance company to connect to a road side assistance company with latest car data such as location and self-diagnosis? Could we auto-compensate the user through that token?

Blockchain can provide the foundational layer to achieve these. It enables a working, frictionless market with tokenised assets always on the market. However, this can only become true when there is a reliable and precise method to define how tokens should be used and transacted. This is the focus of our work on TokenScript.

To carve out the difference, we look at how Tokens are used today.
