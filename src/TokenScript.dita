    <conbody>
	    <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-e0588b59-7fff-f9c6-08d4-576a2c544c53">TokenScript is a
            Tokenisation framework. It wraps HTML and JavaScript code to express Token
            functionalities and makes them deployable in the wallet and on websites. With
            TokenScript, any token can unlock its customized mini Dapp. </p>
        <p>TokenScript creates a <xref href="TokenLayer.dita"/>: A <xref href="DataDriven.dita"/>,
            and <xref href="ContextBased.dita"/> layer between the blockchain and the user. For this
            TokenScript uses token as the basic unit.</p>
	    <p dir="ltr">TokenScript consists of two parts:</p>
        <ul id="ul_omt_14t_ymb">
            <li dir="ltr">TokenScript Engine, which works in the user's wallet, on the web or in a
                browser plugin. The TokenScript Engine provides the runtime <xref
                    href="TokenLayer.dita">Token Layer</xref> for tokens to be used on 3rd party
                websites.</li>
            <li dir="ltr"><xref href="TokenScript-Component.dita"/> are issued and signed by the
                corresponding Token Issuer. They provide additional token information, structure the
                token UX in the wallets, and append rules, data moduls, transaction security
                measurements and much more. </li>
        </ul>
        <p dir="ltr">TokenScript files are <xref href="Signing.dita">signed by the creator of the
                token smart contract or a trusted source</xref> with a public key. Wallets and dApps
            can import and verify the files.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">TokenScript is blockchain agnostic. The main focus of our development is based
            on Ethereum token. But it can be adopted to other blockchains and even combine token and
            interactions of different blockchains. TokenScript is not a standard for token, but
                <xref href="ts-vs-token-standards.dita">a standard for a Token Layer</xref>, which
            enables wallets and apps and websites to work with any non-standardized token as easy as
            with ERC token.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">This guide will educate you about the<xref href="BasicConcepts.dita"> basic
                concepts of TokenScript</xref> and the <xref href="Deploy.dita">deployment</xref> of
            a TokenScript. </p>

            <p><b>For Token Issuers</b></p>
            <p dir="ltr">TokenScript enables token issuers to <b>leave the restrictions of smart
                    contracts behind</b>. It allows to add a lot of information, even image files or
                API lookups to a token, and design a set of business rules and interaction logics
                for it, including <xref href="Attestation.dita">attestations</xref> and structured
                interactions with other tokens. </p>
            <p dir="ltr">Moreover, with TokenScript token issuers can easily and securely update the
                token rules.</p>
            <p><b>For Wallets</b></p>
        </section><section>
            <p dir="ltr">For<b> wallets, </b>TokenScript levels up their capability as the user
                agent for blockchain interactions. Currently most dApps require a third party
                website to interprete the state of the blockchain and to craft smart contract
                transactions. When a wallet imports TokenScript, it learns to fully understand the
                smart contract and craft the required transactions.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, TokenScript allows Token issuers to design the token GUI in the wallet,
                create all kind of complex transactions and append offchain functions. <b>With
                    TokenScript, any token can unlock custom mini apps in the wallet</b>.</p>
            <p><b>For Web and app developer</b></p>
        </section><section>
        <p dir="ltr">Web and app developers can deploy TokenScript into their app. It allows them to
            securely integrate the full scope of token functionality and to trigger specific token
            related actions in the user wallet. Without TokenScript they would need to deeply
            understand blockchain and smart contracts and invest a lot of work to integrate every
            single token. With TokenScript only a very basic knowledge is required.</p>
