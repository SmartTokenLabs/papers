    <shortdesc>TokenLayer connects the applications (websites) and blockchain</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>TokenLayer sits between Blockchain and Websites to provide token functions with the level
            of trust provided by the blockchain and the user experience of a website.</p>
      <section><title>For the web</title>
        <p>For a website, a TokenLayer is like a rail that you can "slot-in" blockchain Tokens,
                similar to how a Payment Rail allows an e-commerce site to on-board users of various
                credit card and payment methods. However, Tokens can provide more important roles
                than just payment. For example, a Car Token allows a car owner to securely authorise
                your website to find a new rental customer of the car, and, when found, to give that
                customer direct access to the car door. More about innovative ways to use tokens on
                websites see <xref href="Tokenization.dita"/></p></section>
      <section><title>For the Token Issuers</title>
        <p>For a Token Issuer, a TokenLayer can be considered as a pre-packaged distribution channel
            to make your tokens available to all websites that also uses a TokenLayer. This is 
            vital to token issuer's business model which is directly affected by the token's reach. 
            A TokenLayer solution supports
            various transaction security features and a packaged user experience. For
            example, if you issue Car Token to car owners, they will be able to use it on websites
            to rent their cars out, or access car status and services with that token. </p></section>
                  <section>
  <title>A TokenLayer is both a standardisation effort and an infrastructure.</title>

        <p>Speaking of standardisation, take, for example, the process of matching Tokens with
            Websites that use them: TokenNegotiation, requires a common conversation channel for
            the website to check what tokens the user has, and for the user to choose the token to
            use, prove the token's ownership or other information if needed. Furthermore, the way
            token invoke each other requires a common expression which benefits from
          standardisation.</p>
        <p>On the infrastructure side, a TokenLayer implementation like TokenScript accesses
                blockchain data on behalf of the token code (in TokenScript files) and the website
                run the necessary cryptographic proofs plus mathematical gymnastics, provides a
                private and secure environment to run Token Cards, and provide security features to
                safe guard user's assets.</p>
