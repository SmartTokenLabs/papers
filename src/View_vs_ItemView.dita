        <section><title>View and ItemView of an Token Card</title>
            <p>Often, for a TokenCard card, an ItemView is used first, and when the user clicks it,
                he gets to see the full view. It is almost always the case in user's wallet. </p>
            <fig>
                <title>ItemView and View used in wallet</title>
                <desc>In AlphaWallet, a user clicks at FIFA ticket token collection and a list of
                    tokens are present through ItemViews. If they clicks the ItemView of a Token,
                    they sees the View of that token. </desc>
                <image href="View_vs_ItemView.svg"/>
            </fig>
            <p>However, on a web page, its web developer can design where and whether ItemView or
                View should be used. In the below example, ItemViews of 2 Tokens (TokenCard) is used
                for user to choose which token to use for the payment. When the user chooses a
                Token, what opens is the "Pay" <xref href="ActionCard.dita"/>, not the <xref
                    href="TokenCard.dita"/>. The View of a TokenCard is unused at all. <fig>

                    <desc>Web developer can decide whether or not ItemView or View is used on their
                        website, and what happens if the user clicks them.</desc>
