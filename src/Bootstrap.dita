    <title>Bootstrap Library</title>
    <shortdesc>TokenScript's bootstrap library is a <xref href="Engine.dita"/> that can be embeded in a web page</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Ideally, when the user uses a browser that supports TokenScript, the website can use
            TokenScrpit features such as <xref href="Card.dita"/> and <xref
                href="TokenNegotiation.dita"/>. This allows a website to use tokens without having
            to write code to do low level access to the blockchain, like calling smart contracts or
            getting update of new blocks.</p>
        <p>If the user's browser is connected to the blockchain, but doesn't support TokenScript
            natively, Bootstrap Library, a JavaScript library, can be included in the
            web page to provide TokenScript functionalities.</p>
        <p>If it detects a user-agent already support TokenScript,
                the token functionalities will be carried
                out with the browser support.
        </p>
	<section><title>Coverage and limitation of Bootstrap Library</title>
        <p>Bootstrap Library provides support most TokenScript functions, like <xref
                href="Card.dita"/>, <xref href="Attestation.dita"/> and <xref
                href="TokenNegotiation.dita"/>. However, it can't replace the TokenScript support in
            the user-agents, because it is deployed on the website as JavaScript library, it can't
            fully support the tokenscript features <xref href="TIPS.dita"/>. For example, if an
                <xref href="ActionCard.dita"/> produces a zero-knowledge proof, the knowledge would
            be leaked to the website as the website can access the runtime memory, therefore doing
			away the Privacy feature (P in <xref href="TIPS.dita"/>.)</p></section>
