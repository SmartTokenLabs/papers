# Distributed Hash Table in Smart Layer

The Distributed Hash Table (DHT) in Smart Layer is a dynamic database that keeps track of which service node is handling which token instance. This crucial piece of infrastructure is maintained by the anchoring nodes and synchronized across the network, ensuring that all nodes have access to up-to-date information.

Anchoring nodes also provide lookup services for this table, enabling nodes and users to quickly determine which service node is responsible for a specific token instance. This functionality is essential for the efficient operation of the network, allowing for quick resolution of queries and efficient routing of requests.

The distribution of tokens across the network follows a set of rules designed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the service. Firstly, tokens are distributed as randomly as possible. This randomness helps to mitigate the impact of any single service node failing or providing poor service, enhancing the overall resilience of the network.

Secondly, tokens are allocated to nodes that match the Service Level Agreement (SLA) required by the token. For example, a movie token, which requires high bandwidth and storage capabilities, would be allocated to nodes that can meet these requirements. This ensures that each token is serviced by a node capable of meeting its specific needs, optimizing the user experience.

Finally, an algorithm such as the Fountain code is used to allocate sufficient redundancy for servicing the token's needs. This means that multiple nodes may hold the same token instance, providing a backup in case a node fails or becomes unavailable. This redundancy further enhances the reliability and resilience of the network, ensuring uninterrupted service for users.

In summary, the Distributed Hash Table in Smart Layer is a key component of the network's infrastructure, enabling efficient distribution of tokens, quick resolution of queries, and robust service delivery. By leveraging randomness, SLA matching, and redundancy, the DHT ensures that the Smart Layer network can provide reliable, high-quality service to all users.
