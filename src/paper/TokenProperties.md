# Token properties

Tokens can be products. Therefore, they need to have different properties: Do tokens expire? AirBNB booking tokens certainly do, but Graduation Diploma tokens probably don't. Should the token owner receive a notification on a specific event? An energy token needs that, for the change in the power supply is dynamic. Is a token stream-able?

How does it look on the user's mobile, and how is it called in a users language? If a buyer wants to purchasea tokenised country estate from a seller, how do they establish a trusted method of communication? If a token entitles the user to do specific actions online, how can the user login to the web services with that token?

However, to diligently design it we need to consider the second part of what Blockchains can do: Integrate the next-generation web.
