# The problem of the Internet as we know it

The internet, as we understand it today, was primarily shaped by two models: a) the public library model, and b) the computer-human interaction model, both of which were championed by pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee.

a. The library model, which is the foundation of the internet, provides free access to information, indexed and cross-referenced by a URI. Its digital equivalent, the URL, signifies the location of data, with no restrictions on accessibility.

b. The computer-human interaction model is a dialogue between two participants - the human user and the machine. While a computer's knowledge is limited, it can guide the user to the appropriate machine.

As a result, the internet was designed as a vast library, where each book is a computer capable of engaging in a conversation.

However, this design has led to numerous contemporary challenges. Let's consider two examples:

Flight Delays and Hotel Rebooking: A user has a flight and a hotel booking. The flight gets delayed, and now the user has to manually contact the hotel to adjust their reservation. This process is not only time-consuming but also adds unnecessary stress to the user's travel experience.

Health Data Management: A user wants to access her health data stored across various healthcare platforms. She needs to remember multiple login credentials, navigate different user interfaces, and manually compile the data. This fragmented and disjointed experience makes it difficult for her to manage and make the most of her health data.

The question arises: why are we, as users, performing tasks that machines excel at? The current design of the internet, akin to a giant library, forces us to keep track of index numbers, much like readers jotting down notes. The vision for the future is to transform the internet from a library-like structure into a more personal assistant-like entity.
