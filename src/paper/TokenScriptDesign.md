# The Architecture of TokenScript with Smart Tokens

TokenScript, an XML markup language, serves as a pivotal link between smart tokens or smart contracts, and wallets, websites, and third-party platforms. Each TokenScript is authenticated by the token issuer and can be updated by the same entity. This ensures that TokenScript maintains the same security attributes as a smart contract, circumventing the drawbacks associated with storing all information in a smart contract.

Incorporating the concept of smart tokens, we have identified several key advantages of TokenScript, including Security, Interoperability, Privacy, Scalability, Availability, and User-Interface. The architecture of TokenScript should facilitate these benefits while supporting a broad range of business scenarios and diverse token and transaction compositions.

The architecture of TokenScript, particularly with the integration of smart tokens, is an ongoing development. While a comprehensive design guide is not yet available, we can outline some of the most significant design principles.
