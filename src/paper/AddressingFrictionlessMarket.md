# Addressing Frictionless Market needs

To understand the requirements for Smart Tokens to create a frictionless market, we need to define markets and the concepts involved. In this context, *a market is a place where delivery versus payment* occurs. The role of Blockchain, enhanced by Smart Tokens, is to reduce reliance on intermediaries and eliminate frictions in markets. 

To comprehend the design considerations for Smart Tokens, we first need to establish a clear understanding of fundamental market concepts, including markets, marketplaces, payments, and deliverables. We'll then explore a real estate example to illustrate the capabilities required of a token markup language.

For clarity, we define the three concepts involved. 

Deliverables
: These are all sorts of things that money can buy: assets, goods, and services. In this context, deliverables are not physical goods, but entitlements. A proto-tokenization of deliverables happened long ago, like land or security titles. However, only with blockchain and the advent of Smart Tokens, they can be transferred in real-time without needing a third party to prevent double spends. Deliverables can greatly benefit from tokenization - if the token design properly reflects their needs.

Payments
: All value transfers done with anything currency-like. In traditional markets, payments are done with Fiat currencies, either as physical banknotes or as electronic transfers through trusted third parties. Blockchain, enhanced by Smart Tokens, eliminates the intermediaries from payments and enables the use of programmable currencies like Ether or Dai.

Market
: This is a concept of individuals exchanging payments versus deliverables. It is neither meant as a single marketplace nor the entirety of all marketplaces. To access a market, users can, but do not have to be on a marketplace like Amazon. 

In traditional markets, both *the deliverable* and *the payment* side tokens must "plug-in" to the *market*. The market participant must transfer both parts of a deal to the market, which adds friction and introduces intermediaries. The promise of Smart Tokens is that both deliverable and payments are *always on the market*. 

Enabling this is a main requirement for Smart Tokens. To do so, Smart Tokens enable tokens to be presented, indexed, transacted, traded, auctioned, combined and so on. We will demonstrate this requirement by both an example for delivery and payment and explain how Smart Tokens can address these needs.
