# The client side can't integrate a web that is not designed to integrate

The pioneers of the web, such as Tim Berners-Lee, envisioned a digital landscape where information is freely accessible and interactions are seamless. However, the reality of the web as we know it today is far from this vision. The current web design, despite its advancements, is fundamentally not designed for integration.

This lack of integration is evident even in technologies that were intended to serve as personal assistants, such as smartphones. Despite their capabilities, smartphones have not been able to fully integrate the web. The reason is simple: the web, in its current form, is not designed for integration. This issue is further exacerbated on mobile devices where tasks such as copy-pasting become even more cumbersome.

The truth is, integration requires more than just client-side efforts. The infrastructure itself needs to support integration. A smartphone, in its current form, is essentially a miniature version of the dial-up Internet, with each app representing a website. Users still need to figure out which app to use for a specific task, and they still need to manually transfer information between apps. For instance, it's currently not possible to ask your smartphone to sum up all the money you can access through your various online banking apps.

The root cause of these inconveniences is the lack of integration in the web. Here are a few examples that illustrate this issue:

Consider the scenario of a traveler whose flight has been delayed. The traveler now has to manually adjust their hotel booking, car rental, and other related services. Each of these services is provided by a different entity, and there is no integration between them. The traveler has to manually navigate between different apps or websites, adjust their bookings, and ensure that everything aligns with the new flight schedule.

Another example can be seen in the healthcare sector. A patient receives a health token that contains their medical history, prescriptions, and other health-related data. However, this token can't be used directly to order medications from a pharmacy or to schedule appointments with a doctor. The patient has to manually transfer the relevant information from their health token to the pharmacy's or doctor's system.

These examples highlight the need for backend integration between different service providers. However, such integration is not often done due to the complexities involved. It requires collaboration and negotiation between the parties involved, and it also poses challenges related to:

Security: Each integration point increases the attack surface, making the system more vulnerable to security breaches. For instance, if one system is compromised, the attacker could potentially gain access to all connected systems.

Availability: The availability of an integrated system is not just about whether it's online or offline. It also involves how efficiently and accurately it can provide the necessary functions and data for integration.

Scalability: The complexity of integration increases exponentially with the number of parties involved. For n parties, there would be nÂ²-n integrations needed, which is a significant challenge. This complexity not only hinders the process of integration but also stifles competition and limits the freedom of the market.

The challenge of integrating the web requires several building blocks that were not part of the original blueprint of the web. These include authentication, ownership, transfer of value, and trading. We will see in the later chapters the introduction of smart tokens provides a promising solution to these challenges.
