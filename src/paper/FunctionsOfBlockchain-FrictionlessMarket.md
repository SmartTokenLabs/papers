# Creating a Frictionless Market

The 80s' "Back to the Future" featured a world of powerful machines filled with hovering boards and flying cars. It didn't happen. As Peter Thiel once famously lamented, "we were promised flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters". The technological advancement of our time is beyond the imagination of the 80s science fiction movies, albeit not through more powerful machinery, but efficient use of the Internet.

Ride-sharing revolutionised the way we organise our daily lives, and AirBNB changed the way we travel. These are the new, less frictional markets. They incur less cost to operate, are more accessible and have finer operational units.

However, despite this web 2.0 revolution, the majority of markets still operate with high costs. The stock market, for example, has so much overhead that it is only justifiable for multi-million dollar businesses to afford to operate under the rules and regulations.

With blockchain, any tokenised asset can be transacted swiftly at any time, as long as it follows the rules, without an intermediary or the process to "enter the market", eliminating frictions and enabling maximum market efficiency.

With the traditional intermediary-operated market model, a trade is made in two stages: entering the market, making a deal. Blockchain can simplify that into a protocol; therefore the blockchain token assets can be considered always on the market.
