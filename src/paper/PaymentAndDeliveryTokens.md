# Payment Token and Deliverable Token

In 2017-2018 we did end up having hundreds of tokens. However, they uniformly fall into one category of token: created with the ERC20 standard they are currency-like, filling up the payment side of the market. There is nearly zero effort devoted to making tokens goods and services - which is the deliverable side of the market and a fundamental need for a market to work.

We categorise tokens as payment tokens and deliverable tokens. ERC20 tokens bearing the hallmarks of payment tokens only fills one side of the market with tokens. They can't lift the market, as they merely compete with other payment-token - like Bitcoin or Ether - on the payment side. They represent a good, but they do not actually deliver. They are rather like gift cards.

During the speculative bubble of 2017, an energy token ICO did not need to provide any explanation of how the tokens can be used. All speculators needed to know is that they represent for example a "stake in the future world of tokenised electricity". As long as the token can inspire investors with imagination, it's good enough for an ICO. There is no more functionality needed other than an ERC20 interface.

Such a speculative token didn't depend on attestations - the proof of actual power production - nor did it need properties like where the energy is provided or for how long it is available. Instead of enabling a frictionless market, those tokens have just been a promise on enabling it, which has been sold as a gift card. By far most will never deliver.

Now that the madness is over, it's time to present the technical framework to make the market actually work.
