# Smart Tokens: A New Paradigm for Next-Generation Web

Tokenization, the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain, holds immense potential for the next-generation web. However, the complexity of tokenization, with its requirements for richness, embeddedness, flexibility, and trust, poses significant challenges. 

Legacy approaches to tokenization, prevalent during the ICO boom, were primarily payment replacements, failing to fully exploit the potential of tokens. These models were rigid, complex, and lacked interoperability, limiting their ability to create a frictionless market and integrate digital services. 

The advent of Smart Tokens heralds a new paradigm. These tokens are not just sophisticated; they are adaptable, capable of interacting with various systems, and can carry trust relationships to third parties. They offer a solution to the shortcomings of the legacy model, paving the way for a more integrated and decentralized web. This chapter delves into the transformative power of Smart Tokens and their potential to reshape the next-generation web.
