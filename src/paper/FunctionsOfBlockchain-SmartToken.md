# Smart Tokens: A New Approach to Tokenisation

Smart tokens introduce a new perspective to tokenisation. Unlike traditional tokens, smart tokens are programmable, with built-in rules and logic that govern their behaviour. This programmability allows for a more dynamic and responsive market, where tokens can adapt to changing conditions, enforce compliance, and automate complex interactions.

Smart tokens can represent a wide range of assets and rights, from tangible assets like real estate to intangible ones like intellectual property. They can also represent a set of conditions or an agreement, such as a contract or a promise. This flexibility and versatility make smart tokens a powerful tool for creating a frictionless market.

However, to fully realise the potential of smart tokens, we need a robust and flexible framework for defining, issuing, and managing them. TokenScript serves this purpose. It is a language and a set of standards for smart token design. It provides a way to define the behaviour and interactions of smart tokens, making them interoperable across different systems and platforms.

By providing a standardised way to define and interact with smart tokens, TokenScript can help facilitate the full potential of the next-generation web, where every asset, every right, every product and service can be tokenised, traded, and integrated into the web in a seamless and frictionless way.
