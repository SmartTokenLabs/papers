    <shortdesc>Cheque protocol solves a common multi-sig use-cases</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>An attestation is a signed message about a certain fact. A cheque is a special case of
            such a message issued to an <term>identifier</term> about some actions to be performed
            by smart contract (like cashing out some crypto asset).</p>
        <p>For example, a cryptographic equivalent of the following messae would be a
                cheque:<q>person identified by bob@example.com can redeem 1 amount of XToken, signed
                by Alice</q>
        </p>
        <p>In TokenScript, a cheque is modeled with a TokenScript just like normal attestations, and
            deliverred off chain, in some encodings (typically, <xref href="MagicLink.dita"/>),
            which the recipient uses to execute the actoin associated with the cheque.</p>
        <p>To use cheque on the blockchain it's necessary to cryptographically hide the identifier
            so that even an adversary who knows the identifier could not link a blockchain
            transaction to the identifier. <xref href="Cheque/privacy_protection.md" format="mdita"
                >Cheque protocol achieves this</xref> through Pedersen Commitment and Zero Knowledge
            Proof.</p>
        <p>The cryptographic details are in <xref href="Cheque/send_token_by_identifier.md" format="mdita"
