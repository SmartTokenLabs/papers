    <body>
        <p>There are 3 types of TokenScript specifications. Throughout a standardisation process
            they may eventually become separate standards, but presently they are all housed under
            TokenScript in 3 streams of development.<note>This is a work in progres to move
                documents from old TokenScript repository. Will take a few weeks to
                accomplish.</note></p><dl>

                    <dd>For a website to use tokens. For example, how to render a token on your
