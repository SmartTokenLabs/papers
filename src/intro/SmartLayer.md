# What is Smart Layer?

Smart Layer is a decentralised protocol for the next web. To the websites, it serves as an integration bus where multiple services by different vendors work together for a web functionality, similar to how websites use Google for login, calendar, checkout, ads and map. Simultaneously, it serves as a tokenization platform for users and token issuers, allowing digital rights and product/services to be tokenized, given functionalities and used in various web use-cases.

The current web thrives on integration, yet its growth has been hindered by the lack of secure, privacy-preserving, and expansionist mechanisms to facilitate such integration. Today, many web services are siloed due to privacy concerns and integration costs, limiting the potential for innovative applications and services. Smart Layer aims to overcome these challenges, enabling a more dynamic and interconnected web ecosystem.
