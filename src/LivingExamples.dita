    <title>TokenScript examples in AlphaWallet</title>
    <shortdesc>Meet the TokenScripts AlphaWallet implemented to improve the user experience for
        popular token.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>The <xref href="https://alphawallet.com/" format="html" scope="external"
                >AlphaWallet</xref> team created<xref
                href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/erc20"
                format="html" scope="external"> TokenScripts for several popular token</xref> which
            tremendously improve the user experience. To try it, just import a wallet holding these
            coins in AlphaWallet or send them to a fresh AlphaWallet account.</p>
        <p><b>DAI</b></p>
        <p>If you don't know DAI, you missed something. DAI is a Dollar token on Ethereum, which is
            not centrally backed by a bank account holding a Dollar equivalent, but by a DAO holding
            and trading a reserve in Ether and other token. It's one of the prime examples of the
            power of smart contracts.</p>
        <p>AlphaWallet's TokenScript implementation adds two functionality to the user interface of
            your DAI Dollar. Select your DAI Dollar and tap on the [â€¦] button on the buttom on the
            right side to see the options.</p>

        <p>
            <ol id="ol_lsk_zkx_4mb">
                <li>You can convert mainchain DAI to xDai and vice versa. xDai is a sidechain which
                    allows cheap transactions. Thanks to TokenScript AlphaWallet contains a powerful
                    xDai bridge straight in your wallet to support scaling Ethereum.</li>
                <li>Get your best rates to lend DAI. One of the practical differences between Dollar
                    in your bank account and DAI Dollar is that you can use smart contracts to get
                    an interest on your DAI. AlphaWallet supports this by displaying the best DeFi
                    rates for DAI Dollar.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>These features where mostly created for demonstration purposes. They can be broadly
            extended: You could bridge DAI to the OMG blockchain or to the Raiden network, create
            the transactions required to lend it for an interest, allow to borrow more DAI or to pay
            back a DAI loan and withdraw your collateral and much more. Token are more than just
            surrogates for money and value - they add functionality to values. A smart wallet needs
            to know these functionalities and integrate them in the user experience.</p>
        <p>Basically, any smart contract author can implement his Smart Contract for DAI dollar as
            an Action Card in the <xref
                href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/erc20/DAI"
                format="html" scope="external">DAI TokenScript</xref>, which is currently maintained
            by the TokenScript team. After reviewing your pull request in the example folder it can
            become part of AlphaWallet.</p>
        <p><b>Compound, AAVE and other DeFi</b></p>
        <p>Maybe you heard about Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It is the technology to use smart
            contracts and token to decentralize not just money but also traditional financial
            services like lending, borrowing or exchanging. </p>
        <p>However, a wallet doesn't know a DeFi app until the wallet authors manually integrated
            the logic of its smart contracts. For AlphaWallet we did this too - but as an author of
            a DeFi app you can do it yourself and submit it to our TokenScript repository for
            implementation in AlphaWallet. We created <xref href="TokenScript-Component.dita">an
                open source infrastructure</xref> for this.</p>
        <p>Take Compound for example. To participate in the money market smart contract you need to
            transform token like DAI or WBTC into cDai or cWBTC. A normal wallet doesn't know much
            about these token and is unable to craft the transactions required to lend, borrow,
            deposit or redeem them. AlphaWallet uses a <xref
                href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/erc20/Compound"
                format="html" scope="external">Compound TokenScript</xref> to allow you to deposit
            cWBTC, to withdraw them and to even see the interest rate as well as the conversion rate
            of cWBTC and WBTC.</p>

        <p>A similar TokenScript exists for AAVE's <xref
                href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/erc20/AAVE"
                format="html" scope="external"> aDAI</xref> token, for <xref
                href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/erc20/Uniswap"
                format="html" scope="external">UniSwap</xref> or <xref
                href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/erc20/DDEX"
                format="html" scope="external">DDEX</xref>. While being very rudimentary, these
            TokenScripts already improve the DeFi user experience of AlphaWallet users tremendously. </p>
        <p>If you are interested in AlphaWallet or TokenScript or have authored a DeFi token, you
            are invited to learn the <xref href="BasicConcepts.dita">basics of TokenScript</xref>,
            scan through our examples and contribute to <xref
                href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/erc20"
                format="html" scope="external">existing TokenScripts </xref>or create new ones. </p>
