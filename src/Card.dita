    <title>Card</title>
    <shortdesc>Cards are a fundamental part of Tokenscript. They define how the token behaves in the
        wallet and are the only part of Tokenscript visible to the user.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>In Tokenscript, Cards trigger actions. They determine how the token behaves in the
            wallet: How it appears, how the wallet processes it and what users can do with it. Cards
            are like little programs which extend the functionality and style of a wallet, tailored
            for a specific token. </p>
        <p>While other parts of Tokenscript are written mostly in XML, cards are built in JavaScript
            (WebAssembly support will be supported too) and declared in XML.</p>
        <p>An important aspect of cards is that they are not in a website or app. They are in the
            TokenScript files and execute solely in the wallet or a TokenScript enabled dapp
            browser. Like a card in a game, a dApp can play it, but is not able to transform it. In
            the web 3.0 cards can become an important enabler of privacy and security: They offload
            operations and information from websites to wallets. They protect the user and reduce
            the risks of database heists.</p>
        <p>Cards allow dApps to use token to interact with wallets in a much more specific and
            manifold way than a smart contract can do. </p>
        <p>A planned feature of TokenScript is to allow the creation and use of decks, which means a
            set of cards that can be combined.</p>
        <p>There are 4 kind of cards: Token Cards, Action Cards, Activity Cards, and Attestation
            Cards.</p>
