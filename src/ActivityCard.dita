    <title>ActivityCard</title>
    <shortdesc>Activity Cards show relevant blockchain events, as well as relevant off-chain
        activities. They serve as a library of what is possible and a timeline of what
        happened.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>In the current version of TokenScript Activity Cards show the history of a token. This
            might seem trivial, since any wallets connects to a blockchain, which already serves a
            shared history of transactions.</p>
        <p>But if you ever used dApps with a standard wallet, you know how important Activity Cards
            are. Usually the wallet just shows transactions, in best cases, it also shows the token
            involved. This might be enough for plain value transfers. </p>
        <p>But if you have token interacting with smart contracts - like, renting a car, lending a
            token, exchanging tokens and so on - the information of a plain transaction gets close
            to zero. Your wallet simply doesn't understand what happened. To make it understand what
            has happened, the wallet developers need to understand each smart contract and implement
            its logic in the wallet.</p>
        <p>Activity Cards solve this problem. The card is assigned to a token and creates, stores
            and loads <xref href="DataObjects.dita">Data Objects</xref>. This makes wallets suddenly smart: They remember not only
            the transaction, but also the purpose of the transaction - that a user rented a car,
            lended or exchanged a token and so on. And all the wallet has to do is to download the
            TokenScript.</p>
        <p>In future releases of TokenScript Activity Cards will support more functions and data
            objects. They can structure what a user can do with a token, like allowing it to redeem
            some other token, restricting its transferability or linking it to something which
            happens in the future.</p>
