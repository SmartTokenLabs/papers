# TokenScript guides

This repo was created in response to the [TokenScript documentation plan](https://community.tokenscript.org/t/what-kind-of-documents-do-we-need-for-tokenscript/366).

Currently Christoph mans this project with input from various team members.

To build the documents:

1. Download and install [Dita Open Kit](https://www.dita-ot.org)
2. Find the executable dita command path, put it in Makefile the first line
3. Run

    $ make Map

Which will create the document output from Map.ditamap in the `out/` directory.
