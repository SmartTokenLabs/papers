# TokenScript guides

This repo has the Guides as part of [TokenScript documentation outlined on the forum](https://community.tokenscript.org/t/what-kind-of-documents-do-we-need-for-tokenscript/366).

It combines the vision and implementation while allowing the vision to be ahead; and implementations to be practical and runnable, following the pace of TokenScript engine releases.
