    <shortdesc>Magic Links does something magic, with cryptography!</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Magic Links are action-triggering links that contains cryptographic information.
            Technically, it's an <xref href="EncodingAttestationInURI.dita"/>.</p>
        <p>Technically, it's an encoded attestation  links in which information about transactions,
            token, TokenScript and much more can be embedded. When a wallet imports a Magic Link, it
            gets a lot of information and instructions. Magic Links can help you to deploy and use a
            TokenScript.</p>
        <p><b>Withdraw transactions</b></p>
        <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-cc2d1346-7fff-f5eb-3caf-c17f48dd8176">One case for Magic
            Links is to pay someone without knowing his address. For this you can create a Magic
            Link which contains an allowance to withdraw a certain amount of Ether or a token like
            DAI by anybody who can prove to own a certain email. If the receiver imports the Magic
            Link in his wallet, the wallet knows where to find the TokenScript to attestate the
            email-address and to create the transaction. </p>
        <p dir="ltr">To allow such withdrawl-transactions, the funds need to be placed in a specific
            smart contract.</p>
        <p><b>Magic Links and TokenScript</b></p>
        <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-7091f6fc-7fff-3bc9-f10b-ffcba202ea8f">Magic Links can be
            an important tool to integrate TokenScript in your apps. </p>
        <p dir="ltr">First, if you send a token a with a Magic Link, you tell the receiving wallet
            how to find the TokenScript. It is like if a Magic Link adds an instruction leaflet to
            the delivery of a token or coin.</p>
        <p>Second, you can trigger Action Cards with a Magic Link. This allows a website or an app
            to talk to the wallet and launch token specific operations. This could be an attestation
            - the link starts a token specific attestation procedure, directing to email, id or
            another token. It could also be a complex transaction pattern or some kind of signed
            message and so on. Everything what can be done with an Action Card can be launched with
            a Magic Link. </p>
